# Create StaticWind

This is an [Astro](https://astro.build) project with some small additions bootstrapped with `npm create staticwind`

## Where do I start?

This is a minimal Astro project setup, already installed and ready to go. It includes a few helpful goodies and clean defaults.

You can treat it just like an Astro application, so if you're familiar with Astro, you'll be right at home. Just dive into the code and start building!

### Placeholders

You need to replace `https://example.com` with your site url in:
- `public/robots.txt`
- `astro.config.mjs`
